The Little Mermaid

  The Complete Script

Disclaimer: This script is taken from numerous viewings of the movie and is not an official script by any means. Portions of this script are copyrighted by Walt Disney Pictures and are used without permission, but I'm not making any bucks off it, so...
An ocean. Birds are flying and porpoises are swimming happily. From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves
Sailors: (singing)
I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho
Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you
In mysterious fathoms below.
Eric:
Isn't this great? The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face . . . a perfect day to be at sea!
Grimsby:
[Leaning over side.] Oh yes . . . delightful . . . .
Sailor 1:
A fine strong wind and a following sea. King Triton must be in a friendly-type mood.
Eric:
King Triton?
Sailor 2:
Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad. Thought every good sailor knew about him.
Grimsby:
Merpeople! Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
Sailor 2:
But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth! I'm tellin' you, down in the depths o' the ocean they live. [He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops away and lands back in the ocean, relieved.]
Sailors: (singing)
Heave. ho. Heave, ho.
In mysterious fathoms below.
[Fish sighs and	swims away.]
Titles. Various fish swimming. Merpeople converge on a great undersea palace, filling concert hall inside. Fanfare ensues.
Seahorse:
  Ahem . . . His royal highness, King Triton! [Triton enters dramatically to wild cheering.] And presenting the distinguished court composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! [Sebastian enters to mild applause.]
Triton:
I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.
Sebastian:
Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever conducted. Your daughters - they will be spectacular!
Triton:
Yes, and especially my little Ariel.
Sebastian:
Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . . [sotto] If only she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . . [He proceeds to podium and begins to direct orchestra.]
Triton's daughters: (singing)
Ah, we are the daughters of Triton.
Great father who loves us and named us well:
Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.
And then there is the youngest in her musical debut,
Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,
To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,
She's our sister, Ar-i . . . 
Shell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent.
Triton:
[Very angry.] Ariel!!
